This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Why i upgrade to v2 ?

I am aware of many shortcomings in previous DeweTour projects and I have tried to fix them but many are fatal. So instead of fixing it all I'd better go with a new one and code more efficiently

## Stack i used

- Preact
- Sass
- Material-UI

## What will I add?

- Google Oauth
- Eslint Checker in with Github action
- Custom Hooks
- Mobile Friendly Design
- Mobile App

For now we use the Clean Architecture Design pattern and combine it with Atomic Design.
